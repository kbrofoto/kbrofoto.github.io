    <p> Debschere is probaly one of my favorite photographers and aesthetics.
      His work has a enigmatic simplicty, it's otherwordly and mezmerizing.
      His site however doesnt quite capture the same vibe as his work.  The site is
      set up more like a blog than a site and everything is sort of jumbled, but's still
      an interesting concept.
