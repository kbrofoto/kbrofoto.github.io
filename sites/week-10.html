    <p> Jayson just graduated last semester from towson university but he's still one of my favorite
      photographers.  His blog reflects his aesthetic perfectly.  It has the juxtoposiion of looking
      sporadic but being very clean.  Because of the digital aspect of his work, the display of his
      images works perfectly.
