    <p> To be an actor, singer, rapper, writer, and a comedien must be an exhausting life.
      I guess you run out of things to say after a while.  I'm gonna assume that's why his
      website is only a black background.  There are no links, no links, no videos, nothing...
      It's probably the best internet representation of his personality, and I'm sure theres some
      intellectul artistic argument that could be made about it, but I think it's really funny.
