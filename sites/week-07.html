    <p> Whats interesting about this site is that it's set up similar to a blog.
      The posts are all pictures from her life that take up most of the home page.
      More of the advertising or promotional stuff is over in the navigation.
      For a celebrity this is a very efficeint, simple, and entertaining way to
      organize your site.
